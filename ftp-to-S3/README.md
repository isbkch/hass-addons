# Home Assistant Add-on: FTP To S3

Backup to S3 files uploaded via FTP

## About

Many cameras allows uploading of files via FTP. But I wanted something that allows me to upload these recordings to an S3 bucket.
This addon will automatically upload your recordings to Amazon S3 immediately after they are taken and will optionally upload existing recordings if they are not found in S3.
